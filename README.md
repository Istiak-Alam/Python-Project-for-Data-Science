## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results & Insights

**Tesla (TSLA)**
- Dramatic stock price surge (2020â€“2021), strongly correlated to exponential revenue growth.
- Key market milestones (product launches, S&P 500 inclusion) marked inflection points for both price and fundamentals.

**GameStop (GME)**
- High price volatility (notably 2021 "meme-stock" spike) not matched by revenue improvement.
- Revenue largely flat/declining, highlighting disconnect between price narrative and financials.

*Interactive Plotly charts available in the notebook for both companies.*
